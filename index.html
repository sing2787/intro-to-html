<p>Im someone who finds joy in the little things—whether it's watching the sunset, doodling in a sketchbook, or getting lost in a good story. I love spending time outdoors, especially near water. I'm a quiet observer but full of curiosity and always looking to understand the world around me..</p>
<p>I value honesty, creativity, and kindness in everything I do. I enjoy journaling, music, and spending time with close friends and family. I often find myself reflecting on life and appreciating the small wins. I believe that being genuine and open-minded makes every experience more meaningful.</p>
